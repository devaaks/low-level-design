# Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns are a category of design patterns in software engineering that focus on organizing classes and objects in a flexible and efficient manner. These patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures while keeping the system easy to understand and maintain.

Structural patterns primarily address how objects and classes are connected and how they work together to form larger structures. They promote flexibility, reusability, and maintainability by providing various techniques for organizing and composing objects.

## Common Structural Design Patterns

1. **Adapter Pattern**: Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a wrapper with a compatible interface.

2. **Bridge Pattern**: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

3. **Composite Pattern**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Clients can treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

4. **Decorator Pattern**: Attaches additional responsibilities to objects dynamically, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

5. **Facade Pattern**: Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, simplifying complex systems by providing a higher-level interface.

6. **Flyweight Pattern**: Reduces memory usage and improves performance by sharing common state among multiple objects instead of storing it individually.

7. **Proxy Pattern**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it, acting as a wrapper or intermediary.

8. **Private Class Data Pattern**: Restricts access to an object's data by keeping it private and providing controlled access through public methods.

These patterns help improve code organization, maintainability, and scalability by providing guidelines for structuring classes and objects effectively. They enable developers to create systems that are easier to understand, modify, and extend, while also promoting good design principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, and separation of concerns.
