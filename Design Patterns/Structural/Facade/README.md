# Facade

Facade pattern hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface to the client using which the client can access the system. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern adds an interface to existing system to hide its complexities.

This pattern involves a single class which provides simplified methods required by client and delegates calls to methods of existing system classes.

#### Real-World Analogy

Imagine a building, the facade is the outer wall that people see, but behind it is a complex network of wires, pipes, and other systems that make the building function. The facade pattern is like that outer wall. It hides the complexity of the underlying system and provides a simple interface that clients can use to interact with the system.
