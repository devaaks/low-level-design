# Behavioral Design Patterns

It deals with the interaction and communication between objects and classes. They focus on how objects collaborate and delegate responsibilities to achieve specific behaviors or functionalities in a flexible and maintainable way.

### These patterns primarily address the following concerns:

**Communication**: They define how objects and classes communicate with each other.
**Responsibilities**: They distribute responsibilities among objects to promote a clear and efficient design.
**Encapsulation**: They help in encapsulating behavior within objects, making the system more modular and easier to extend or modify.


#### Some common behavioral design patterns include:

1. **Observer Pattern**: Allows a one-to-many relationship between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

2. **Strategy Pattern**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

3. **Command Pattern**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It also allows for logging, queuing, and transactional support.

4. **Iterator Pattern**: Provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

5. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**: Allows an object to send a request to a chain of handlers, avoiding coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request.

6. **State Pattern**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

7. **Visitor Pattern**: Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure without changing the classes on which it operates.

8. **Template Method Pattern**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

These patterns, when used appropriately, can greatly enhance the flexibility, maintainability, and scalability of software systems by promoting loose coupling and high cohesion between objects and classes.
