# Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

## What does the pattern consist of?
Most patterns are described very formally so people can reproduce them in many contexts. Here are the sections that are usually present in a pattern description:

**Intent** of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.<br>
**Motivation** further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.<br>
**Structure** of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.<br>
**Code** example in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.<br>

Some pattern catalogs list other useful details, such as applicability of the pattern, implementation steps and relations with other patterns.
