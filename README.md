# Low Level Design

Low-Level Design (LLD) is a crucial phase that involves crafting detailed specifications for individual components of a software system. It provides a micro-level design by delving deep into the logic behind each module, data structures, algorithms, and interfaces between components.

## Purpose of LLD: 
LLD bridges the gap between high-level design concepts and actual code implementation. It focuses on how individual components will function, detailing data structures, algorithms, and the intricate relationships between software modules.

## Key Aspects of LLD:
* Detailed Specifications: LLD offers exhaustive application detailing on how different parts of the unit will work together.
* Granular-Level Details: It covers functional logic of each module with pseudocode, database tables, properties, interfaces, API details, dependencies, and error message listings.
* Implementation Guidance: LLD serves as a one-stop reference material for developers to stay focused on deliverables and maintain best coding practices.

## Advantages of LLD:
* Optimized Code: Helps developers write efficient and optimized code.
* Early Issue Identification: Aids in identifying potential issues early in the development process.
* Enhanced Collaboration: Improves collaboration and communication among developers, designers, and stakeholders.
